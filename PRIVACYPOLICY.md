### Discord Bot Privacy Policy

1. Information We Collect
- **User Data**: We may collect your Discord user ID, username, and any other public information you provide while using the bot.
- **Server Data**: We may collect server IDs, channel IDs, and other server-related information required for the bot's functionality.
- **Message Data**: The bot may temporarily store messages or content for processing purposes, such as handling commands or providing responses. These messages are not stored long-term unless explicitly stated.

2. How We Use Your Information
- **Bot Functionality**: The data collected is used to provide the bot's features and ensure proper operation.
- **Improvements**: We may analyze usage data to improve the bot's features and performance.
- **Security and Abuse Prevention**: Data may be used to detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of the bot.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- **Third Parties**: We do not share your data with third parties unless required by law or necessary to protect our rights or comply with a legal process.
- **Discord**: As the bot operates within Discord's platform, data shared with the bot may be accessible to Discord in accordance with their own privacy policies.

4. Data Retention
- **Temporary Data**: Most data, such as messages and command inputs, are processed in real-time and not stored beyond the immediate need.
- **Long-Term Data**: In cases where data must be stored (e.g., server preferences or user-specific settings), it will be retained only as long as necessary for the bot's functionality.

5. Your Rights
- **Access and Correction**: You have the right to access and correct any personal data we hold about you. Contact us if you need assistance with this.
- **Data Deletion**: If you wish to delete your data, you may contact us, and we will delete the data to the extent possible without impairing the bot's functionality.

6. Security
- **Measures**: We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.
- **Limitations**: While we strive to protect your data, no security measure is entirely foolproof. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
- **Updates**: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the [Bot Name] support server or through other communication channels.
